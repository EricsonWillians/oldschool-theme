# Oldschool Theme

A high-contrast monokai theme loosely inspired by QBasic and MS-DOS in order to satify one's vague nostalgia, and that is actually possible to be productive with.

Available in seven options:

 - qbasic
 - darker-qbasic
 - olive
 - gray
 - purple
 - maroon
 - evil
 - teal
 - green
