## Important Note:

Due to the loss of access to the original account on the VSCode marketplace, I am releasing this new separate extension. It will continue to receive updates and support. Thank you to all the users who have enjoyed the Oldschool Theme over the years â€” your support means the world, and I hope you'll enjoy these new editions as well.
